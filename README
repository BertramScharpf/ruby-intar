= ruby-intar  --  Interactive Ruby

A simple Irb replacement



== About

The Intar project was started in times when Irb was a rather
unconvenient tool, without colors, difficult to call from
inside an application and so on.

Today, Intar is a tool far less complex than Irb.

Yet, Intar is more robust. Have a look at what happens
after this in Irb and in Intar:

  prompt> Thread.new { sleep 3 ; Thread.main.raise "stop" }



== Usage

=== Subcommands

  obj.method !      enter a sub-Intar
  obj.each !        enter multiple sub-Intars
  obj.method !x     enter a sub-Intar with variable x

  \q                exit from the innermost sub-Intar
  \q!               exit from the innermost sub-Intar loop
  \q!!              exit from all levels

  \h                get a list of all subcommands
