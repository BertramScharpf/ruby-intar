= ruby-intar  --  Interactive Ruby

A simple Irb replacement



== About

The Intar project was started in times when Irb was a rather
unconvenient tool, without colors, difficult to call from
inside an application and so on.

Today, Intar is a tool far less complex than Irb.

Yet, Intar is more robust. Try this in Irb and in Intar:

  prompt> Thread.new { sleep 3 ; Thread.main.raise "stop" }
